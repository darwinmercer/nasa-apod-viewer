# NASA Picture of the Day
A simple web app I built to practice asynchronous JavaScript and working with APIs. Fetches NASA's daily astronomy picture using their public API.

## What I'm Learning
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, fetch API)
- API integration
- Error handling

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- NASA APOD API

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Click "GENERATE" to fetch content

## API Usage
Uses NASA's APOD API with the public DEMO_KEY. Get your own key at https://api.nasa.gov/ if needed.
